    <p>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate
        your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your
        infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for
        shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running
        it in production.</p>
    <h3>What is the benefits of Docker ?</h3>
    <p>Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using
        local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration
        and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.</p>
